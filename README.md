Hierarchical time-tracking based on simple text-files
=====================================================

System for simple text-based hierarchical time-tracking.

Consider a table of the following shape:

| Timestamp            | Activity     |
|----------------------|--------------|
| 2018-08-08T17:00:00Z | Work:Writing |

Where *Activity* is a string of an activity, separated into a hierarchy by
colons and *Timestamp* is a timestamp of some user-defined format (In this case ISO-8601)

You now have a series of segments where the user has stuff

Status
------

This is a totally work-in-progress project. Expect things to break and stuff.


Plans
-----

- Make the Python tool nicer
- Make an Android app
